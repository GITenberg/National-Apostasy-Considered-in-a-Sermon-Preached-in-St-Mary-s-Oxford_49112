<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the following pages were
prepared for the press, the calamity, in anticipation of which
they were written, has actually overtaken this portion of the
Church of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; The Legislature
of England and Ireland, (<i>the members of which are not even
bound to profess belief in the Atonement</i>,) this body has
virtually usurped the commission of those whom our <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> entrusted with <i>at least one
voice</i> in making ecclesiastical laws, on matters wholly or
partly spiritual.&nbsp; The same Legislature has also ratified,
to its full extent, this principle;&mdash;that the Apostolical
Church in this realm is henceforth only to stand, in the eye of
the State, as <i>one sect among many</i>, depending, for any
preeminence she may still appear to retain, merely upon the
accident of her having a strong party in the country.</p>
<p>It is a moment, surely, full of deep solicitude to all those
members of the Church who still believe her authority divine, and
the oaths and obligations, by which they are bound to her, <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>undissolved
and indissoluble by calculations of human expediency.&nbsp; Their
anxiety turns not so much on the consequences, to the State, of
what has been done, (<i>they</i> are but too evident,) as on the
line of conduct which they are bound themselves to pursue.&nbsp;
How may they continue their communion with the Church
<i>established</i>, (hitherto the pride and comfort of their
lives,) without any taint of those Erastian Principles on which
she is now avowedly to be governed?&nbsp; What answer can we make
henceforth to the partisans of the Bishop of Rome, when they
taunt us with being a mere Parliamentarian Church?&nbsp; And how,
consistently with our present relations to <i>the State</i>, can
even the doctrinal purity and integrity of the <span
class="smcap">most Sacred Order</span> be preserved?</p>
<p>The attention of all who love the Church is most earnestly
solicited to these questions.&nbsp; They are such, it will be
observed, as cannot be answered by appealing to precedents in
English History, because, at most, such could only shew, that the
difficulty might have been raised before.&nbsp; It is believed,
that there are hundreds, nay thousands of Christians, and that
soon there <a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>will be tens of thousands, unaffectedly anxious to be
rightly guided with regard to these and similar points.&nbsp; And
they are mooted thus publicly, for the chance of eliciting, from
competent judges, a correct and early opinion.</p>
<p>If, under such trying and delicate circumstances, one could
venture to be positive about any thing, it would seem safe to
say, that in such measure as it may be thought incumbent on the
Church, or on Churchmen, to submit to any profane intrusion, it
must at least be their sacred duty, to declare, promulgate, and
record, their full conviction, that it <i>is</i> intrusion; that
they yield to it as they might to any other tyranny, but do from
their hearts deprecate and abjure it.&nbsp; This seems the least
that can be done: unless we would have our children&rsquo;s
children say, &ldquo;There was once here a glorious Church, but
it was betrayed into the hands of Libertines for the real or
affected love of a little temporary peace and good
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 22, 1833.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>1 <span
class="smcap">Samuel</span> xii. 23.</p>
<p><i>As for me</i>, <span class="smcap"><i>God</i></span><i>
forbid that I should sin against the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Lord</i></span><i> in ceasing to pray for
you</i>: <i>but I will teach you the good and the right
way</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> public occasions, such as the
present, the minds of Christians naturally revert to that portion
of Holy Scripture, which exhibits to us the will of the Sovereign
of the world in more immediate relation to the <i>civil</i> and
<i>national</i> conduct of mankind.&nbsp; We naturally turn to
the Old Testament, when <i>public</i> duties, <i>public</i>
errors, and <i>public</i> dangers, are in question.&nbsp; And
what in such cases is natural and obvious, is sure to be more or
less right and reasonable.&nbsp; Unquestionably it is a mistaken
theology, which would debar Christian nations and statesmen from
the instruction afforded by the Jewish scriptures, under a
notion, that the circumstances of that people were
<i>altogether</i> peculiar and unique, and therefore irrelevant
to every other case.&nbsp; True, there <i>is</i> hazard of
misapplication, as there is whenever men teach by example.&nbsp;
There is <i>peculiar</i> hazard, from the sacredness and delicacy
of the subject; since dealing with things supernatural and
miraculous as if they were ordinary human precedents, would be
not only unwise, <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>but profane.&nbsp; But these hazards are more than
counterbalanced by the absolute certainty, peculiar to this
history, that what is there commended was right, and what is
there blamed, wrong.&nbsp; And they would be effectually obviated
if men would be careful to keep in view this
caution:&mdash;suggested every where, if I mistake not, by the
manner in which the Old Testament is quoted in the
New:&mdash;that, as regards reward and punishment, <span
class="smcap">God</span> dealt formerly with the Jewish people in
a manner analogous to that in which He deals now, not so much
with Christian <i>nations</i>, as with the <i>souls of individual
Christians</i>.</p>
<p>Let us only make due allowances for this cardinal point of
difference, and we need not surely hesitate to avail ourselves,
as the time may require, of those <i>national</i> warnings, which
fill the records of the elder church: the less so, as the
discrepancy lies rather in what is revealed of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> providence, than in what is
required in the way of human duty.&nbsp; Rewards and punishments
may be dispensed, visibly at least, with a less even hand; but
what <i>tempers</i>, and what <i>conduct</i>, <span
class="smcap">God</span> will ultimately reward and
punish,&mdash;<i>this</i> is a point which cannot be changed: for
it depends not on our circumstances, but on His essential,
unvarying Attributes.</p>
<p>I have ventured on these few general observations, because the
impatience with which the <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>world endures any remonstrance on
religious grounds, is apt to shew itself most daringly, when the
<i>Law</i> and the <i>Prophets</i> are appealed to.&nbsp; Without
any scruple or ceremony, men give us to understand that they
regard the whole as obsolete: thus taking the very opposite
ground to that which was preferred by the same class of persons
two hundred years ago; but, it may be feared, with much the same
purpose and result.&nbsp; <i>Then</i>, the Old Testament was
quoted at random for every excess of fanatical pride and cruelty:
<i>now</i>, its authority goes for nothing, however clear and
striking the analogies may be, which appear to warrant us in
referring to it.&nbsp; The two extremes, as usual, meet; and in
this very remarkable point: that they both avail themselves of
the <i>supernatural</i> parts of the Jewish revelation to turn
away attention from that, which <i>they</i>, of course, most
dread and dislike in it: its authoritative confirmation of the
<i>plain dictates of conscience</i> in matters of civil wisdom
and duty.</p>
<p>That portion, in particular, of the history of the chosen
people, which drew from Samuel, the truest of patriots, the wise
and noble sentiment in the text, must ever be an unpleasing and
perplexing page of scripture, to those, who would fain persuade
themselves, that a nation, even a Christian nation, may do well
enough, as such, without <span class="smcap">God</span>, and
without His Church.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>For what if the Jews <i>were</i>
bound to the Almighty by ties common to no other people?&nbsp;
What if He <i>had</i> condescended to know <i>them</i> in a way
in which He was as yet unrevealed to all families of the earth
besides?&nbsp; What if, as their relation to Him was nearer, and
their ingratitude more surpassing, so they might expect more
exemplary punishment?&nbsp; Still, after all has been said, to
exaggerate their guilt, <i>in degree</i>, beyond what is supposed
possible in any nation whatever now, what can it come to, in
<i>kind</i> and in <i>substance</i>, but only this;&mdash;that
they rejected <span class="smcap">God</span>? that they wished
themselves rid of the moral restraint implied in His peculiar
presence and covenant?&nbsp; They said, what the prophet Ezekiel,
long after, represents their worthy posterity as saying,
&ldquo;<i>We will be as the heathen</i>, <i>the families of the
countries</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Once
for all, we will get rid of these disagreeable, unfashionable
scruples, which throw us behind, as we think, in the race of
worldly honour and profit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is this indeed a tone of
thought, which Christian nations cannot fall into?&nbsp; Or, if
they should, has it ceased to be displeasing to <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; In other words, has He forgotten
to be angry with impiety and practical atheism?&nbsp; Either this
must be affirmed, or men must own, (what is clear at once to
plain unsophisticated readers,) that this first overt <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>act, which
began the downfall of the Jewish nation, stands on record, with
its fatal consequences, for a perpetual warning to all nations,
as well as to all individual Christians, who having accepted
<span class="smcap">God</span> for their king, allow themselves
to be weary of subjection to Him, and think they should be
happier if they were freer, and more like the rest of the
world.</p>
<p>I do not enter into the question, whether visible temporal
judgments are to be looked for by Christian nations,
transgressing as those Jews did.&nbsp; Surely common sense and
piety unite, in representing this inquiry as, practically, one of
no great importance.&nbsp; When it is once known for certain that
such and such conduct is displeasing to the <span
class="smcap">King</span> of kings, surely common sense and piety
concur in setting their mark of reprobation on such conduct,
whether the punishment, sure to overtake it, come to-morrow, or a
year hence, or wait till we are in another world.</p>
<p>Waving this question, therefore, I proceed to others, which
appear to me, I own, at the present moment especially, of the
very gravest practical import.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms, by which one may judge most fairly,
whether or no a nation, as such, is becoming alienated from <span
class="smcap">God</span> and <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>?</p>
<p>And what are the particular duties of sincere <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Christians,
whose lot is cast by divine Providence in a time of such dire
calamity?</p>
<p>The conduct of the Jews, in asking for a king, may furnish an
ample illustration of the <i>first</i> point: the behaviour of
Samuel, then and afterwards, supplies as perfect a pattern of the
<i>second</i>, as can well be expected from human nature.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The case is at least possible, of a nation, having
for centuries acknowledged, as an essential part of its theory of
government, that, <i>as</i> a Christian nation, she is also a
part of Christ&rsquo;s Church, and bound, in all her legislation
and policy, by the fundamental rules of that Church, the case is,
I say, conceivable, of a government and people, so constituted,
deliberately throwing off the restraint, which in many respects
such a principle would impose on them, nay, disavowing the
principle itself; and that, on the plea, that other states, as
flourishing or more so in regard of wealth and dominion, do well
enough without it.&nbsp; Is not this desiring, like the Jews, to
have an earthly king over them, when the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> their <span class="smcap">God</span> is
their king?&nbsp; Is it not saying in other words, &ldquo;We will
be as the heathen, the families of the countries,&rdquo; the
aliens to the Church of our Redeemer?</p>
<p>To such a change, whenever it takes place, the immediate
impulse will probably be given by some pretence of danger from
without,&mdash;<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>such as, at the time now spoken of, was furnished to the
Israelites by an incursion of the children of Ammon; or by some
wrong or grievance in the executive government, such as the
malversation of Samuel&rsquo;s sons, to whom he had deputed his
judicial functions.&nbsp; Pretences will never be hard to find;
but, in reality, the movement will always be traceable to the
same decay or want of faith, the same deficiency in Christian
resignation and thankfulness, which leads so many, as
individuals, to disdain and forfeit the blessings of the
gospel.&nbsp; Men not impressed with religious principle
attribute their ill success in life,&mdash;the hard times they
have to struggle with,&mdash;to any thing rather than their own
ill-desert: and the institutions of the country, ecclesiastical
and civil, are always at hand to bear the blame of whatever seems
to be going amiss.&nbsp; Thus, the discontent in Samuel&rsquo;s
time, which led the Israelites to demand a change of
constitution, was discerned by the Unerring Eye, though perhaps
little suspected by themselves, to be no better than a fresh
development of the same restless, godless spirit, which had led
them so often into idolatry.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over
them.&nbsp; According to all the works, which they have done
since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this
day, wherewith they have forsaken <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Me, and served other gods, so do they
also unto thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation14a"></a><a
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>The charge might perhaps surprise many of them, just as, in
other times and countries, the impatient patrons of innovation
are surprised, at finding themselves rebuked on religious
grounds.&nbsp; Perhaps the Jews pleaded the express countenance,
which the words of their Law, in one place, <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> seemed, by anticipation, to lend to
the measure they were urging.&nbsp; And so, in modern times, when
liberties are to be taken, and the intrusive passions of men to
be indulged, precedent and permission, or what sounds like them,
may be easily found and quoted for every thing.&nbsp; But Samuel,
in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> name, silenced all
this, giving them to understand, that in His sight the whole was
a question of <i>motive</i> and <i>purpose</i>, not of ostensible
and colourable argument;&mdash;in His sight, I say, to whom we,
as well as they, are nationally responsible for much more than
the soundness of our deductions as matter of disputation, or of
law; we are responsible for the meaning and temper in which we
deal with His Holy Church, established among us for the salvation
of our souls.</p>
<p>These, which have been hitherto mentioned as omens and tokens
of an Apostate Mind in a nation, have been suggested by the
portion itself <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>of sacred history, to which I have ventured to direct
your attention.&nbsp; There are one or two more, which the nature
of the subject, and the palpable tendency of things around us,
will not allow to be passed over.</p>
<p>One of the most alarming, as a symptom, is the growing
indifference, in which men indulge themselves, to other
men&rsquo;s religious sentiments.&nbsp; Under the guise of
charity and toleration we are come almost to this pass; <i>that
no difference</i>, <i>in matters of faith</i>, <i>is to
disqualify for our approbation and confidence</i>, <i>whether in
public or domestic life</i>.&nbsp; Can we conceal it from
ourselves, that every year the practice is becoming more common,
of trusting men unreservedly in the most delicate and important
matters, without one serious inquiry, whether they do not hold
principles which make it impossible for them to be loyal to their
<span class="smcap">Creator</span>, <span
class="smcap">Redeemer</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Sanctifier</span>?&nbsp; Are not offices conferred,
partnerships formed, intimacies courted,&mdash;nay, (what is
almost too painful to think of,) do not parents commit their
children to be educated, do they not encourage them to
intermarry, in houses, on which Apostolical Authority would
rather teach them to set a mark, as unfit to be entered by a
faithful servant of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?</p>
<p>I do not now speak of public measures only or chiefly; many
things of that kind may be thought, whether wisely or no, to
become from <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>time to time necessary, which are in reality as little
desired by those who lend them a seeming concurrence, as they
are, in themselves, undesirable.&nbsp; But I speak of the spirit
which leads men to <i>exalt</i> in every step of that kind; to
<i>congratulate</i> one another on the supposed decay of what
they call an exclusive system.</p>
<p>Very different are the feelings with which it seems natural
for a true Churchman to regard such a state of things, from those
which would arise in his mind on witnessing the mere triumph of
<i>any given set of adverse opinions</i>, exaggerated or even
heretical as he might deem them.&nbsp; He <i>might</i> feel as
melancholy,&mdash;he <i>could</i> hardly feel so indignant.</p>
<p>But this is not a becoming place, nor are these safe topics,
for the indulgence of mere <i>feeling</i>.&nbsp; The point really
to be considered is, whether, according to the coolest estimate,
the fashionable liberality of this generation be not ascribable,
in a great measure, to the same temper which led the Jews
voluntarily to set about degrading themselves to a level with the
idolatrous Gentiles?&nbsp; And, if it be true any where, that
such enactments are forced on the Legislature by public opinion,
is <span class="GutSmall">APOSTASY</span> too hard a word to
describe the temper of that nation?</p>
<p>The same tendency is still more apparent, because the fair
gloss of candour and forbearance is wanting, in the surly or
scornful impatience <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>often exhibited, by persons who would regret passing for
unbelievers, when Christian motives are suggested, and checks
from Christian principles attempted to be enforced on their
public conduct.&nbsp; I say, &ldquo;their public conduct,&rdquo;
more especially; because in that, I know not how, persons are apt
to be more shameless, and readier to avow the irreligion that is
in them;&mdash;amongst other reasons, probably, from each feeling
that he is one of a multitude, and fancying, therefore, that his
responsibility is divided.</p>
<p>For example:&mdash;whatever be the cause, in this country of
late years, (though we are lavish in professions of piety,) there
has been observable a growing disinclination, on the part of
those bound by <span class="GutSmall">VOLUNTARY OATHS</span>, to
whatever reminds them of their obligation; a growing disposition
to explain it all away.&nbsp; We know what, some years ago, would
have been thought of such uneasiness, if betrayed by persons
officially sworn, in private, legal, or commercial life.&nbsp; If
there be any subjects or occasions, now, on which men are
inclined to judge of it more lightly, it concerns them deeply to
be quite sure, that they are not indulging, or encouraging a
profane dislike of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> awful
Presence; a general tendency, as a people, to leave Him out of
all their thoughts.</p>
<p>They will have the more reason to suspect <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>themselves,
in proportion as they see and feel more of that <i>impatience
under pastoral authority</i>, which our <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> Himself has taught us to consider as
a never-failing symptom of an unchristian temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that despiseth you,
despiseth Me.&rdquo; <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; Those words
of divine truth put beyond all sophistical exception, what common
sense would lead us to infer, and what daily experience
teaches;&mdash;that disrespect to the Successors of the Apostles,
<i>as such</i>, is an unquestionable symptom of enmity to Him,
who gave them their commission at first, and has pledged Himself
to be with them for ever.&nbsp; Suppose such disrespect general
and national, suppose it also avowedly grounded not on any
fancied tenet of religion, but on mere human reasons of
popularity and expediency, either there is no meaning at all in
these emphatic declarations of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, or that nation, how highly soever she
may think of her own religion and morality, stands convicted in
His sight of a direct disavowal of His Sovereignty.</p>
<p>To this purpose it may be worth noticing, that the ill-fated
chief, whom <span class="smcap">God</span> gave to the Jews, as
the prophet tells us, in his anger, <a name="citation18b"></a><a
href="#footnote18b" class="citation">[18b]</a> and whose
disobedience and misery were referred by himself to his
&ldquo;fearing the people, and obeying their voice,&rdquo; <a
name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c"
class="citation">[18c]</a> whose conduct, therefore, may be
fairly taken as a sample of what public opinion <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>was at that
time supposed to require,&mdash;his first step in apostasy was an
intrusion on the sacrificial office, <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a> as the last and
greatest of his crimes was persecuting David, whom he well knew
to bear <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> special
commission.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> forbid, that any
Christian land should ever, by her prevailing temper and policy,
revive the memory and likeness of Saul, or incur a sentence of
reprobation like his.&nbsp; But if such a thing should be, the
crimes of that nation will probably begin in infringement on
Apostolical Rights; she will end in persecuting the true Church;
and in the several stages of her melancholy career, she will
continually be led on from bad to worse by vain endeavours at
accommodation and compromise with evil.&nbsp; Sometimes
<i>toleration</i> may be the word, as with Saul when he spared
the Amalekites; sometimes <i>state security</i>, as when he
sought the life of David; sometimes <i>sympathy with popular
feeling</i>, as appears to have been the case, when violating
solemn treaties, he attempted to exterminate the remnant of the
Gibeonites, in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah. <a
name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a>&nbsp; Such are the sad but obvious
results of separating religious resignation altogether from
men&rsquo;s notions of civil duty.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But here arises the other question, on which it was
proposed to say a few words; and <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>with a view to which, indeed, the
whole subject must be considered, if it is to lead to any
practical improvement.&nbsp; What should be the tenor of
<i>their</i> conduct, who find themselves cast on such times of
decay and danger?&nbsp; How may a man best reconcile his
allegiance to <span class="smcap">God</span> and his Church with
his duty to his country, that country, which now, by the
supposition, is fast becoming hostile to the Church, and cannot
therefore long be the friend of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?</p>
<p>Now in proportion as any one sees reason to fear that such is,
or soon may be, the case in his own land, just so far may he see
reason to be thankful, especially if he be called to any national
trust, for such a complete pattern of his duty, as he may find in
the conduct of Samuel.&nbsp; That combination of sweetness with
firmness, of consideration with energy, which constitutes the
temper of a perfect public man, was never perhaps so beautifully
exemplified.&nbsp; He makes no secret of the bitter grief and
dismay, with which the resolution of his countrymen had filled
him.&nbsp; He was prepared to resist it at all hazards, had he
not received from <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself
directions to give them their own way; protesting, however, in
the most distinct and solemn tone, so as to throw the whole blame
of what might ensue on their wilfulness.&nbsp; Having so
protested, and found them obstinate, he does not therefore at
once forsake their service, he continues discharging <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>all the
functions they had left him, with a true and loyal, though most
heavy, heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> forbid
that I should sin against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in
ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the
right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should it ever happen (which <span class="smcap">God</span>
avert, but we cannot shut our eyes to the danger) that the
Apostolical Church should be forsaken, degraded, nay trampled on
and despoiled by the state and people of England, I cannot
conceive a kinder wish for her, on the part of her most
affectionate and dutiful children, than that she may,
consistently, act in the spirit of this most noble sentence; nor
a course of conduct more likely to be blessed by a restoration to
more than her former efficiency.&nbsp; In speaking of the Church,
I mean of course, the laity, as well as the clergy in their three
orders,&mdash;the whole body of Christians united, according to
the will of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, under the
Successors of the Apostles.&nbsp; It may, by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> blessing, be of some use, to
shew how, in the case supposed, the example of Samuel might guide
her collectively, and each of her children individually, down
even to minute details of duty.</p>
<p>The Church would, first of all, have to be constant, as
before, in <span class="GutSmall">INTERCESSION</span>.&nbsp; No
despiteful usage, no persecution, could warrant her in ceasing to
pray, as did her first fathers and patterns, for the State, and
all who are in authority.&nbsp; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>That duty once well and cordially
performed, all other duties, so to speak, are secured.&nbsp;
Candour, respectfulness, guarded language,&mdash;all that the
apostle meant, in warning men not to &ldquo;speak evil of
dignities,&rdquo; may then, and then only, be practised, without
compromise of truth and fortitude, when the habit is attained of
praying as we ought for the very enemies of our precious and holy
cause.</p>
<p>The constant sense of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
presence and consequent certainty of final success, which can be
kept up no other way, would also prove an effectual bar against
the more silent but hardly less malevolent feeling, of disgust,
almost amounting to misanthropy, which is apt to lay hold on
sensitive minds, when they see oppression and wrong triumphant on
a large scale.&nbsp; The custom of interceding, even for the
wicked, will keep the Psalmist&rsquo;s reasoning habitually
present to their thoughts: &ldquo;Fret not thyself because of the
ungodly, neither be thou envious against the evil doers: for they
shall soon be cut down like the grass, and be withered even as
the green herb . . .&nbsp; Leave off from wrath, and let go
displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be moved to do
evil.&rdquo; <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>Thus not only by supernatural aid, which we have warrant of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word for expecting, but
even in the way of natural consequence, the <i>first</i> <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>duty of the
church and of churchmen, <span
class="GutSmall">INTERCESSION</span>, sincerely practised, would
prepare them for the <i>second</i>;&mdash;which, following the
words of Samuel as our clue, we may confidently pronounce to be
<span class="GutSmall">REMONSTRANCE</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
teach you the good and the right way.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Remonstrance</span>, calm, distinct, and
persevering, in public and in private, direct and indirect, by
word, look, and demeanour, is the unequivocal duty of every
Christian, according to his opportunities, when the Church
landmarks are being broken down.</p>
<p>Among laymen, a deep responsibility would appear to rest on
those particularly, whose profession leads them most directly to
consider the boundaries of the various rights and duties, which
fill the space of civilized Society.&nbsp; The immediate
machinery of change must always pass through their hands: and
they have also very great power in forming and modifying public
opinion.&nbsp; The very solemnity of this day may remind them,
even more than others, of the close amity which must ever subsist
between equal justice and pure religion; Apostolical religion,
more especially, in proportion to her superior truth and
exactness.&nbsp; It is an amity, made still more sacred, if
possible, in the case of the Church and Law of England, by
historical recollections, associations, and precedents, of the
most engaging and ennobling cast.</p>
<p>But I return to the practical admonition afforded <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>her, in
critical periods, by Samuel&rsquo;s example.</p>
<p>After the accomplishment of the change, which he deprecated,
his whole behaviour, to Saul especially, is a sort of expansion
of the sentiment in the text.&nbsp; It is all earnest <span
class="GutSmall">INTERCESSION</span> with <span
class="smcap">God</span>, grave, respectful, affectionate <span
class="GutSmall">REMONSTRANCE</span> with the misguided man
himself.&nbsp; Saul is boldly rebuked, and that publicly, for his
impious liberality in sparing the Amalekites, yet so, as not to
dishonour him in the presence of the people.&nbsp; Even when it
became necessary for <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
prophet to shew that he was in earnest, and give the most
effectual of warnings, by separating himself from so unworthy a
person;&mdash;when &ldquo;Samuel came no more to see Saul;&rdquo;
<a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a>&mdash;even then, we are told, he still
&ldquo;mourned for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the same principle, come what may, we have ill learned the
lessons of our Church, if we permit our patriotism to decay,
together with the protecting care of the state.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
powers that be, are ordained of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; whether they foster the true
Church, or no.&nbsp; Submission and order are still duties.&nbsp;
They were so in the days of pagan persecution; and the more of
loyal and affectionate feeling we endeavour to mingle with our
obedience, the better.</p>
<p>After all, the surest way to uphold or restore <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>our
endangered Church, will be for each of her anxious children, in
his own place and station, to resign himself more thoroughly to
his <span class="smcap">God</span> and <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> in those duties, public and private,
which are not immediately affected by the emergencies of the
moment:&mdash;the daily and hourly duties, I mean, of piety,
purity, charity, justice.&nbsp; It will be a consolation
understood, by every thoughtful Churchman, that, let his
occupation be, apparently, never so remote from such great
interests, it is in his power, by doing all as a Christian, to
credit and advance the cause he has most at heart; and what is
more, to draw down <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
blessing upon it.&nbsp; This ought to be felt, for example, as
one motive more to exact punctuality in those duties, personal
and official, which the return of an Assize week offers to our
practice; one reason more for veracity in witnesses, fairness in
pleaders, strict impartiality, self-command, and patience, in
those on whom decisions depend; and for an awful sense of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> presence in all.&nbsp; An
Apostle once did not disdain to urge good conduct upon his
proselytes, upon the ground, that, so doing, they would adorn and
recommend the doctrine of <span class="smcap">God</span> our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; Surely, then,
it will be no unworthy principle, if any man be more circumspect
in his behaviour, more watchful and fearful of himself, more
earnest in his petitions <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>for spiritual aid, from a dread of
disparaging the holy name of the English Church, in her hour of
peril, by his own personal fault or negligence.</p>
<p>As to those who, either by station or temper, feel themselves
most deeply interested, they cannot be too careful in reminding
themselves, that one chief danger, in times of change and
excitement, arises from their tendency to engross the whole
mind.&nbsp; Public concerns, ecclesiastical or civil, will prove
indeed ruinous to those, who permit them to occupy all their care
and thoughts, neglecting or undervaluing ordinary duties, more
especially those of a devotional kind.</p>
<p>These cautions being duly observed, I do not see how any
person can devote himself too entirely to the cause of the
Apostolical Church in these realms.&nbsp; There may be, as far as
he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him.&nbsp; He may
have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world, before
he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and
irreligion.&nbsp; But, <i>if he be consistent</i>, he possesses,
to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and
as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other
cause in the world can impart in the same degree:&mdash;he is
calmly, soberly, demonstrably <span class="GutSmall">SURE</span>,
that, sooner or later, <span class="GutSmall">HIS WILL BE THE
WINNING SIDE</span>, and that the victory will be complete,
universal, eternal.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>He need
not fear to look upon the efforts of Antichristian powers, as did
the Holy Apostles themselves, who welcomed the first persecution
in the words of the Psalmist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
thing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take
counsel together, against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and against His Anointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For of a truth against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou
hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">For to do whatsoever thy hand and
thy counsel determined before to be done</span>.&rdquo; <a

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
